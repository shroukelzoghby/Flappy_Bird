# Project Overview
1- The NEAT algorithm is a powerful evolutionary approach for evolving neural networks, particularly effective when the network architecture needs to adapt along with the weights.
2- This project leverages NEAT to evolve bird behaviors in the Flappy Bird game, aiming to achieve increasingly successful navigation through pipes and maximize score.


# Configuration

The NEAT configuration parameters are defined in the config-feedforward.txt file. You can modify these parameters to fine-tune the evolution process, such as:
1-Population size
2-Mutation rate and amount
3-Selection criteria
